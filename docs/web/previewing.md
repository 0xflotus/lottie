# Previewing Animations

## Lottiefiles.com
If you drag an exported json file onto [lottiefiles.com](http://lottiefiles.com), it will preview it directly in the browser.
You can also share the link or scan the ar code with the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airbnb.lottie&hl=en) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lottie-preview/id1231821260?mt=8) app to preview it there as well.

## Poster snapshot
You can preview or take an svg snapshot of the animation to use as poster. After you render your animation, you can take a snapshot of any frame in the animation and save it to your disk. I recommend to pass the svg through an svg optimizer like https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/ and play around with their settings.<br/>
