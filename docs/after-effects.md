## Creating Lottie animations

Creating animations for Lottie is a bit different than the usual After Effects workflow. Here are some general tips for creating Lottie animations.

## Keep it Simple

When building for Lottie you always have to keep in mind that these JSON files need to be as compact and small as possible for mobile products. For example use parenting whenever you can. Duplicating the same keyframes on a similar layers adds extra code. Only use path keyframe animations when absolutely have to. Those eat up the most space because its adding data for each vertex on each keyframe. Techniques such as Autotrace, or the wiggler that give you a keyframe every frame, may make your JSON file size very large and may impact performance negatively. There has to be a balance with the way the compositions are setup so that things are as efficient as possible.

## Shape layers for vector artwork / Adobe Illustrator

Convert any Adobe Illustrator, EPS, SVG, or PDF assets to shape layers otherwise they will not work in your Lottie animation. After you've converted to shape layers remove the assets from your composition so they aren't exported with the JSON. Shape layers is where Lottie does best.

## Work @1x

Working at 1x ensures that all of your strokes will be right on different dimensions. All px values will be converted to points on iOS and dp on Android.

## No expressions or effects

Lottie does not yet support expressions, or any effects from the effects menu.

## Matte size matters

Using alpha mattes can impact performance. If you're using an alpha matte or an alpha inverted matte, the size of the matte will impact performance even more. If you must use Mattes, cover the smallest area you can.

## Debugging

If an animation is broken. Try debugging the animation by exporting only certain layers at a time to see which ones work and which ones don't. After you isolate the problem areas, be sure to file a github issue with the After effects file attached and then you can choose to remake those layers in a different way.

## No Blending modes or Luma mattes

Blending modes such as Multiply, Screen or Add, don't work nor do Luma mattes.

## Supporting multiple screen sizes

You can export longer (or taller) animations and use centerCrop on the View containing the Lottie animation and that will give you coverage for multiple screen sizes.

## Make Nulls 0%

If you're using a null to control a bunch of layers and usually turn the visibility off, be sure to turn the visibility ON and turn the opacity to 0% otherwise they won't come through in the JSON file

## Sketch workflow

If you are bringing in assets from Sketch, you can export artboards as PDFs. Bring that PDF into illustrator to break things out into layers and do some organization. Then save that PDF as an illustrator file that can be brought into After Effects and converted into a shape layer. Hopefully one day someone writes a script / tool to automate this process
