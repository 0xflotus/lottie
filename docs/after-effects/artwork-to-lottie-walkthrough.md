# Artwork to Lottie workflow

This walkthrough explains how to get artwork from Sketch to Lottie. If you already have an SVG skip to step 3. If you're working in illustrator start at step 4.

It doesn't dive into any animation techniques. For that check out one of our other walkthroughs.

We're assuming you have three things. Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After Effects, and [Bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin). For a walkthrough on how to install Bodymovin go [here](/bodymovin-installation.md).
